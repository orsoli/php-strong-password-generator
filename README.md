### Description: 
**We need to create a page that allows our users to use our (fairly) secure password generator. The exercise is divided into various milestones, and itâ€™s very important to develop them in an orderly manner.**

### Milestone 1: 
**Create a form that sends the password length via GET. Our function will use this data to generate a random password (composed of letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols) to return to the user. We will write everything (logic and layout) in a single index.php file.**

### Milestone 2: 
**Once the correct functioning of our code has been verified, move the logic to a functions.php file that we will then include in the main page.**

### Milestone 3 (BONUS): 
**Instead of displaying the password in the index, perform a redirect to a dedicated page that, through $_SESSION, will retrieve the password to display to the user.**

### Milestone 4 (BONUS): 
**Manage additional parameters for the password: which characters to use between numbers, letters, and symbols. They can be selected individually (e.g., only numbers) or combined together (e.g., numbers and symbols, or all three together). Also, give the user the option to allow or disallow the repetition of identical characters.**
